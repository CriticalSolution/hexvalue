# hexvalue
It is about producing hexadecimal value. "HexValues.txt" can be find relatively same folder which you works.

# How to test

1. Make new object

2. Call writeFile with hexadecimal length and how many rows want to produce. writeFile methods takes 2 variables. First one is about hexadecimal length. Another is about  how many rows want to produce.

public static void main(String[] args) {
  HexValue hv = new HexValue();
  hv.writeFile(6, 444);
}

# Changing location of output file

If you want to change address of output of result, you have to change "fileName".
